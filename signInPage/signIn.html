		<p>Insert the very long and very boring disclaimer here. Make sure that it is very clear that the disclaimer is separated into two categoriesL the UW-Stout disclaimer, and add-ons from the ISP club.<br/>There may be a way to put the disclaimer into a separate ".txt" file, and link to that within the HTML file. If so, then we can use that to have the dislaimer in one easy-to-update place. </p>
